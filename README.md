# Welcome to the App Seriesly - Capstone Project

### This is a capstone project for the web development bootcamp of [neuefische](https://www.neuefische.de/)

With Seriesly you can keep track of your watch progress in over 7000 series.

- You can search for series,
- add them to your list of currently watched series,
- mark every episode as watched to never forget again where you left of.
  All data is stored locally in your browser and will only be reset if you clear your browser cache.

## How to and navigation

When you open [Seriesly](capstone-project-virid.vercel.app) you will start at the Home page and see a list of 20 popular series.

There are several ways of navigating through Seriesly:

- By clicking on "read more" on any series, you are able to navigate to a more detailed view for that particular series.
- At the bottom of every page, there is a navigation bar with which you can quickly go to either Search, Home or Watching.

### Detail View

When in the so called Detail View, you may add the respective series to your Watching list.
Another click on this button will remove said series from your Watching list.

By clicking on any of the seasons, a list of episodes from that series will expand.
Those episodes can be marked as watched to keep track of your progress.

The changes made in this view will be stored locally in your browser.

### Search

By navigating to the Search page, you can search for new and exiting series.

### Watching

By navigating to the Watching page, you will see a list of all the series that you previously marked as being currently watched.
